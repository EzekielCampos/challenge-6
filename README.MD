# Challenge 6 UC Berkeley Extension Weather Dashboard Application

## Description

This project is a weather board application that allows a user to search a city to get the current weather and a five day future forecast.  The users search history will be saved and displayed on the page if they choose to select a city that was previously looked at. In order to get the weather information for each city, a server side API was implemented to retrieve the weather data.  The focus of this project was using the fetch method to request data from OpenWeatherMap, and use that information to display to the user.  In addition to that I learned how transverse the data that was returned and utilize it in functions. As well as how to detect and troubleshoot errors that may arise from fetch request. The biggest takeaway from this project was the importance of reading the documentation.  Many bugs arose from not carefully reading the documentation that could have easily been avoided.  

## Usage

This application can be utilized by any user if they are looking to check the weather for any particular city.  Each time a user searches their value will be saved and rendered to the side of the page. If they wish to check a city they already searched, they can click on the city and it will render the forecast.
